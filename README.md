## Positve Aspects 

The logical of your code works but there are some issue that doesn't allow your execute. Please look at aspects to improve on to help with completing the task.

## Aspects to improve on 

Your code isn't working due to indentention in  lines 3, 4, and 10. There's also to many blank spaces which isn't effient please ensure you don't leave to many blank spaces.

Please ensure that you use clear and understandable variable names to help in understanding your code.

To ensure that you or any other developer understand what is happening in your code please use comments. Which
makes it easier to read your code.

## Feedback
Please make the necessary changes and I'll be happy to review your code.

# Section C

## Explaination

In the program called ResistorNetworks.java (written in Java) is a program that finds the ohms of resistance based on the connection. If the resistor is connected to a series it will sum up the resistance whereas parallel finds the total resistance to equal the sum of the same individual resistor.

### Space complexity
All function's algorithm is 0(n) as the calculations are linear which also apply to the rest of the program. If the space complexity were to be visiulized it would be fair ensure the program runs smoothly and not execeeding any memory
